## Kaggle Competition
## About this Competition
Identify a problem with a cassava plant using a photo from a relatively inexpensive camera? This competition will challenge you to distinguish between several diseases that cause material harm to the food supply of many African countries. In some cases the main remedy is to burn the infected plants to prevent further spread, which can make a rapid automated turnaround quite useful to the farmers.
